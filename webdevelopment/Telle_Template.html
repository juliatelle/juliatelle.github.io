<h3>About Me</h3>

  <p> 
    Hello! My name is Julia Telle, and I am a second semester Learning Technologies and Design student with an emphasis in Technology in Schools. I live in St. Louis, Missouri and just wrapped up my sixth year as an eighth grade language arts teacher. I eventually hope to work in the K-12 setting as an instructional technology specialist. I do not have any experience related to web application and development, so this course is definitely out of my comfort zone. I hope to learn basic terminology and procedures related to web development that can help me support teachers and district staff in their digital endeavors. I also hope to apply what I learn from this course to my future capstone portfolio, even if it’s fairly down the road. When not studying or teaching, I love to read, exercise, and try out new recipes. I also love to travel- my husband and I will be traveling to Peru later this summer, and I couldn’t be more excited! <br/></p>

<h3>Professional History</h3>
  <p>
    I’m an educator and graduate student passionate about making literature accessible to <strong>all</strong> readers through technology. I’m currently completing my Master’s in Learning Technologies and Design with an emphasis in Technology in Schools at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I expect to graduate in summer 2026. <br/></p>

  <p>
    My background is in secondary English education. I earned my undergraduate degree from Missouri State University and began my teaching career at Nixa High School, where I taught 9th and 10th grade English. I shared my love for Shakespeare with students as we studied plays like <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>, and <em>Julius Caesar</em>. <br/></p>

  <p>
    Since 2021, I’ve taught 8th grade language arts at Selvidge Middle School in St. Louis. I primarily work with students who are reading two or more grade levels below their peers. My goal is to use technology and thoughtful web design to help all readers — especially struggling ones — connect with classic literature.</p>
