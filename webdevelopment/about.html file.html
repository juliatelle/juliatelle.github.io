<h1>Julia Telle</h1>

<h3>Hi!</h3>

  <p>
    I’m Julia Telle—an educator and graduate student passionate about making literature accessible to <strong>all</strong> readers through technology. I’m currently completing my Master’s in Learning Technologies and Design with an emphasis in Technology in Schools at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I expect to graduate in summer 2026. <br/></p>
  <p>
    My background is in secondary English education. I earned my undergraduate degree from Missouri State University and began my teaching career at Nixa High School, where I taught 9th and 10th grade English. I shared my love for Shakespeare with students as we studied plays like <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>, and <em>Julius Caesar</em>. <br/></p>
  <p>
    Since 2021, I’ve taught 8th grade language arts at Selvidge Middle School in St. Louis. I primarily work with students who are reading two or more grade levels below their peers. My goal is to use technology and thoughtful web design to help all readers — especially struggling ones — connect with classic literature.</p>
