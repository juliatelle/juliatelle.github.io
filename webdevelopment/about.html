<h1>Julia Telle</h1> 

<h3>About Me</h3>

<p> Hi! I’m Julia Telle—an <strong>educator</strong> and <strong>graduate student</strong> passionate about making literature accessible to <em>all</em> readers through technology. I’m currently completing my Master’s in Learning Technologies and Design with an emphasis in Technology in Schools at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I expect to graduate in summer 2026.</p>

<p> My background is in secondary English education. I earned my undergraduate degree from Missouri State University and began my teaching career at Nixa High School, where I taught 9th and 10th grade English. I shared my love for Shakespeare with students as we studied plays like Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and Julius Caesar.</p>

<p> Since 2021, I’ve taught 8th grade language arts at Selvidge Middle School in St. Louis. I primarily work with students who are reading two or more grade levels below their peers. My goal is to use technology and thoughtful web design to help all readers — <em>especially</em> struggling ones — connect with classic literature.</p>
