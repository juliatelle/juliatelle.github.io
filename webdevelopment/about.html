   <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p> Hello! My name is Julia Telle. I am a Learning Technologies and Design graduate student with an emphasis in Technology 
    in Schools. I previously attended Missouri State University and graduated in 2019 with my BS.Ed in Secondary English 
    Education. I live in St. Louis, Missouri and just began my seventh year as an eighth grade language arts teacher. 
    I eventually hope to work in the K-12 setting as an instructional technology specialist.</p>

    <p>In this course, I hope to learn basic terminology and procedures related to web development. I believe this foundational
    knowledge is beneficial for a variety of work and educational environments. I also hope to apply what I learn from this 
    course to my future capstone portfolio.</p>

    <p>When not studying or teaching, I love to read, watch sports, and go on hikes with my husband and our chocolate lab, Heinz. 
    I also love to run and am currently training for my first half marathon!</p>
