     Hello! My name is Julia Telle, and I am a second semester Learning Technologies and Design student with an emphasis in Technology in Schools. I live in St. Louis, Missouri and just wrapped up my sixth year as an eighth grade language arts teacher. I eventually hope to work in the K-12 setting as an instructional technology specialist. I do not have any experience related to web application and development, so this course is definitely out of my comfort zone. I hope to learn basic terminology and procedures related to web development that can help me support teachers and district staff in their digital endeavors. I also hope to apply what I learn from this course to my future capstone portfolio, even if it’s fairly down the road. When not studying or teaching, I love to read, exercise, and try out new recipes. I also love to travel- my husband and I will be traveling to Peru later this summer, and I couldn’t be more excited!
